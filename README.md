Breakit:
This is my implementation of another classic game, Breakout; written in c++

To play:
First, download a zip file of this repository onto your computer, then unzip.
Use the command line or terminal to cd to the directory, and type 'make' to compile
use command './breakit' to run the program

Use the arrow keys to move your paddle left and right, pressing 'q' will exit the game

To beat the game, clear all 6 levels
