Breakit
This is my implementation of another classic game written in c++

First, download a zip file of this repository onto your computer, then unzip.
cd to the directory, and type 'make' to compile
type './breakit' to run the program

Use the arrow keys to move your paddle left and right, pressing 'q' will exit the game

To beat the game, clear all 6 levels
